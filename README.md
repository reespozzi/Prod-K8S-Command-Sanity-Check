You need to follow the below steps to include this within your own ZSH.

## 1. Clone this repository to your local machine and move into the dir with `cd Prod-K8S-Command-Sanity-Check`.
## 2. Give the setter script execution rights by running `chmod +x setter.sh`.
## 3. Run the setter script with `./setter.sh`. Please keep in mind this will remove your current ZSHRC file. Check you're happy with this.

You should now be prompted to check your commands if your current kubectl context contains `prod`, `production` or `live`.
